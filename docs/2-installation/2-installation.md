## Tasks SQL Powered Plugin

### From BRAT

To install a pre-release, download and enable the [Obsidian42 BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin, add the beta repository `sytone/obsidian-tasks-x`, and then have BRAT check for updates.

### Manual installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/sytone/obsidian-tasks-x/releases/latest)
2. Extract the obsidian-tasks-x-plugin folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `{vault}/.obsidian/plugins/`
   Note: On some machines the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On MacOS you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder.
3. Reload Obsidian
4. If prompted about Safe Mode, you can disable safe mode and enable the plugin.

Follow the steps below to install Tasks.

1. Search for "Tasks SQL Powered" in Obsidian's community plugins browser
2. Enable the plugin in your Obsidian settings (find "Tasks SQL Powered" under "Community plugins").
3. Check the settings. It makes sense to set the global filter early on (if you want one).
4. Replace the "Toggle checklist status" hotkey with "Tasks: Toggle Done".
    - I recommend you remove the original toggle hotkey and set the "Tasks" toggle to `Ctrl + Enter` (or `Cmd + Enter` on a mac).
5. Optional: bind a hotkey to the command `Tasks SQL Powered: Create or edit` to have quick access to the Tasks modal.

## Original Tasks Plugin
